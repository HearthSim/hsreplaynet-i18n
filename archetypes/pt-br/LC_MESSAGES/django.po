Recruit Hunter focuses on overwhelming the opponent with big minions dropped every turn starting from Turn 6, most notably Charged Devilsaur and King Krush to land a massive face hit right away. Deathrattle Hunter is a bit different. Instead, it wants to win the game through tempo gains from its Deathrattle minions and proccing them multiple times."

Zoo is naturally a deck that takes a lot of damage. Usually, it doesn't matter - if you're the aggressive one, your health total is not a big deal. There seemed to be no point in playing healing before. However, the popular build of Zoo now plays healing not only for the sake of gaining health, but also because of the synergies."

msgid "One could say that the history of the Big Spell Mage started in Un'Goro with Burn Mage, a slow deck, which wanted to control the board through majority of the game, and then turn around and start killing your opponent with big tempo swings. This deck is similar, but it leans even more on the control side thanks to the late game capabilities of Frost Lich Jaina. The \"real\" Big Spell Mage was created in Kobolds & Catacombs, when Dragon's Fury, Dragoncaller Alanna as well as a few more \"Big Spell\" synergies were printed."

Thanks to that hand size, Even Warlock can play big threats such as Mountain Giant or Twilight Drake as early as Turn 4, overwhelming most of the meta decks with the sheer amount of stats it places on the board each turn."

Thanks to the +5 Spell Damage provided by the Dragon, even the weakest damage spells (such as Moonfire) turn into powerful burns. Given the card's high 9 mana cost, normally you can't do much with the remaining 1 mana. That problem is fixed by Twig of the World Tree, giving Druid extra 10 mana to copy Malygos or play more expensive spells."

msgid "Control Warlock is a deck first created in Kobolds & Catacombs, which shares a lot of similarities with Cube Warlock - both rely on cheating out bigger minions early, as well as massive late game tempo swing with Bloodreaver Gul'dan. However, unlike Cube Warlock, Control version takes a much more reactive route, switching out threats for removals."
