"While Deathrattle Hunter might look similar to another Hunter archetype, "
"which got popular during this expansion - Recruit Hunter - in reality, these"
" are vastly different archetypes. Recruit Hunter focuses on overwhelming the"
" opponent with big minions dropped every turn starting from Turn 6, most "
"notably Charged Devilsaur and King Krush to land a massive face hit right "
"away. Deathrattle Hunter is a bit different. Instead, it wants to win the "

"While Zoo Warlock is a very old archetype, one of the Hearthstone's classic,"
" players have tried a new approach to the deck late in The Witchwood meta. "
"Zoo is naturally a deck that takes a lot of damage. Usually, it doesn't "
"matter - if you're the aggressive one, your health total is not a big deal. "
"There seemed to be no point in playing healing before. However, the popular "
"build of Zoo now plays healing not only for the sake of gaining health, but "
"also because of the synergies."

"Tempo Mage is one of the old Hearthstone archetypes, which was present "

"current version looks similar to the ones that were played back in the day, "
"even before Blackrock Mountain. With some Secret and Spell synergies, as "
"well as multiple ways to burn down the opponent, it wants to finish the "
"games in an explosive manner."

"One could say that the history of the Big Spell Mage started in Un'Goro with"
" Burn Mage, a slow deck, which wanted to control the board through majority "
"of the game, and then turn around and start killing your opponent with big "
"tempo swings. This deck is similar, but it leans even more on the control "
"side thanks to the late game capabilities of Frost Lich Jaina. The \"real\" "
"Big Spell Mage was created in Kobolds & Catacombs, when Dragon's Fury, "
"Dragoncaller Alanna as well as a few more \"Big Spell\" synergies were "
"printed."

"Spell Hunter is a very unique archetype, in a way that it doesn't run any "
"minions for the sake of cards such as To My Side! and Rhok'delar. The class "
"still has multiple ways to flood the board or drop big bodies, but in order "
"to do that, it uses spells (e.g. Emerald Spellstone) and a Hero card - "
"Deathstalker Rexxar."
