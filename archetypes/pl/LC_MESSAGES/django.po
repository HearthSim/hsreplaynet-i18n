msgstr ""

#: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-guide/odd-rogue-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Odd Rogue is the class’ latest tempo archetype that relies on Baku the Mooneater’s powerful ability to provide an extremely effective hero power alongside an aggressive package of cards to quickly close out games. It’s one of the strongest decks in the Witchwood metagame and one that can single-handedly get you to high ranks if you figure out its finicky little details in the more problematic matchups."
msgstr ""

#: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-guide/deathrattle-hunter-deck-list-guide/
msgid "While Deathrattle Hunter might look similar to another Hunter archetype, which got popular during this expansion - Recruit Hunter - in reality, these are vastly different archetypes. Recruit Hunter focuses on overwhelming the opponent with big minions dropped every turn starting from Turn 6, most notably Charged Devilsaur and King Krush to land a massive face hit right away. Deathrattle Hunter is a bit different. Instead, it wants to win the game through tempo gains from its Deathrattle minions and proccing them multiple times."
msgstr ""

#: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-guide/heal-zoo-warlock-deck-list-guide/
msgid "While Zoo Warlock is a very old archetype, one of the Hearthstone's classic, players have tried a new approach to the deck late in The Witchwood meta. Zoo is naturally a deck that takes a lot of damage. Usually, it doesn't matter - if you're the aggressive one, your health total is not a big deal. There seemed to be no point in playing healing before. However, the popular build of Zoo now plays healing not only for the sake of gaining health, but also because of the synergies."
msgstr ""

#: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-guide/tempo-mage-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Tempo Mage is one of the old Hearthstone archetypes, which was present through the game's history in many different forms. Funnily enough, the current version looks similar to the ones that were played back in the day, even before Blackrock Mountain. With some Secret and Spell synergies, as well as multiple ways to burn down the opponent, it wants to finish the games in an explosive manner."
msgstr ""

#: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-guide/big-spell-control-mage-deck-list-guide/
msgid "One could say that the history of the Big Spell Mage started in Un'Goro with Burn Mage, a slow deck, which wanted to control the board through majority of the game, and then turn around and start killing your opponent with big tempo swings. This deck is similar, but it leans even more on the control side thanks to the late game capabilities of Frost Lich Jaina. The \"real\" Big Spell Mage was created in Kobolds & Catacombs, when Dragon's Fury, Dragoncaller Alanna as well as a few more \"Big Spell\" synergies were printed."
msgstr ""

#: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-guide/spell-hunter-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Spell Hunter is a very unique archetype, in a way that it doesn't run any minions for the sake of cards such as To My Side! and Rhok'delar. The class still has multiple ways to flood the board or drop big bodies, but in order to do that, it uses spells (e.g. Emerald Spellstone) and a Hero card - Deathstalker Rexxar."

msgid "Even Warlock is a new version of Handlock, a classic deck that got its name from massive hand sizes it could attain easily thanks to the Warlock's Hero Power - Life Tap - and Genn Greymane made it even easier to do so. Thanks to that hand size, Even Warlock can play big threats such as Mountain Giant or Twilight Drake as early as Turn 4, overwhelming most of the meta decks with the sheer amount of stats it places on the board each turn."

msgid "Even Shaman is a board-centric midrange deck that uses buffs to make use of the Totem boards it is able to build, and also makes good use of Charge minions to get even more value from its buffs. It is ready to fight for the board against any other deck and can deliver a lot of damage quickly if left uncontested."
msgstr ""

#: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-guide/odd-paladin-deck-list-guide/
msgid "Odd Paladin's main power is the upgraded Hero Power activated by Baku the Mooneater. The deck is built around flooding the board all the time - with 2x 1/1 Hero Power and a bunch of other ways to summon multiple small minions, the deck takes advantage of all kinds of AoE buffs, even cards that were only used in Basic decks before, such as Raid Leader or Stormwind Champion."
msgstr ""

#: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-guide/control-priest-deck-list-guide/
msgid "In the past, Control Priest was a very slow, reactive deck, which put attrition as its main win condition. Right now, while the deck still keeps its reactive nature, its main win condition shifted to chip damage from Shadowreaper Anduin and burst from Mind Blasts (hence the deck's second name - Mind Blast Priest)."

msgid "Malygos Druid is a combo deck built around its namesake, Malygos. Thanks to the +5 Spell Damage provided by the Dragon, even the weakest damage spells (such as Moonfire) turn into powerful burns. Given the card's high 9 mana cost, normally you can't do much with the remaining 1 mana. That problem is fixed by Twig of the World Tree, giving Druid extra 10 mana to copy Malygos or play more expensive spells."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control Warlock is a deck first created in Kobolds & Catacombs, which shares a lot of similarities with Cube Warlock - both rely on cheating out bigger minions early, as well as massive late game tempo swing with Bloodreaver Gul'dan. However, unlike Cube Warlock, Control version takes a much more reactive route, switching out threats for removals."
