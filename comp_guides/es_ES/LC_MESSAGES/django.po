If you're going hand buff route, have a [[Bream Counter||98509]] in your hand that scales every time you play a Murloc. Mrglin' Burglar is an option to further scale your Bream in hand. Finally, ending units such as [[Bassgill||98926]] and [[Choral Mrrrglr||98948]] help duplicate the stats of your venom. The best way to cap out your board is with as many Bassgills as possible while holding [[Bile Spitter||122219]] to summon from them."

Then, the next things to attack should be [[Monstrous Macaw||62230]] that procs [[Manasaber||98831]], because this first fills out the board with taunts and then adds the rally to the whole board. Do that with as many Macaws as possible. Every 4 things that die will give your board insane rallys because your Poultron's will attack and swing with all the combined rallies. Also don't reborn your Stegodon!! With [[Sprightly Scarab||108909]], you want to first reborn your Poultrons, then the Manasabers, then the Macaws. Finally, run Chameleon after Poultron to copy it. Comp is much better if your Poultron is golden."
