"Scale your bloodgems using an early [[Sanguine Refiner||122566]]. Then, "
"[[Razorfen Vineweaver||122562]] casts 3 or more permanent gems on itself "
"each fight, while [[Bloodsnout Warlord||122564]] casts an insane amount of "
"temporary gems on your board. You also want to shield as many Quilboars as "
"possible using [[Hog Watcher||122737]]. In the endgame, you may gem transfer"
" using [[Gem Confiscation||110642]] onto a [[Corrupted Bristler||120033]] to"
" double the effectiveness of your blood gems."

"[[Sky Admiral Rogers||122516]] or other bounty generation combined with "
"[[Proud Privateer||122520]] gives you lots of gold to hit more of your "
"setup. At some point, you'll be infinite with bounties, and you'll need "
"spell scaling to really capitalize on the bounty scaling. Cards such as "
"[[Sundered Matriarch||122672]] and [[Timecap'n Hooktail||103676]] gets "
"insane value because of the amount of spells you're playing, and [[Tranquil "
"Meditative||119942]] or [[Felfire Conjurer||120299]] helps improve the "
"quality of your bounties."
