msgid "You want to generate as many murlocs as possible. Typically this is done with cycling Tad and [[Primalfin Lookout||60028]].

[[Magicfin Mycologist||122277]] generates insane value with Brann is the key to being infinite. If you're going hand buff route, have a [[Bream Counter||98509]] in your hand that scales every time you play a Murloc. Mrglin' Burglar is an option to further scale your Bream in hand. Finally, ending units such as [[Bassgill||98926]] and [[Choral Mrrrglr||98948]] help duplicate the stats of your Bream. The best way to cap out your board is with as many Bassgills as possible while holding [[Bile Spitter||122219]] to summon from them."

msgid "[[Primeval Monstrosity||122223]] scales your menagerie unit every time you Rally, so you want to fill out your board with the best Rally units for each tribe. I recommend ones that can get windfury, such as [[Charmwing||122086]] or [[Holo Rover||115674]] or [[Bonker||70173]], but non windfury ones are great to add to your board as well. I also recommend [[Geared Guard||122371]] and [[Bile Spitter||122219]] to add some shields and venom to your board. A play that you MUST know about for this comp is that if you play a Reef Explorer on tavern 5 with every tribe in board, you're GUARANTEED to get Monstrosity."

Also don't reborn your Stegodon!! With [[Sprightly Scarab||108909]], you want to first reborn your Poultrons, then the Manasabers and horses, then the Macaws.
