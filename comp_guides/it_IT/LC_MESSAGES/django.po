msgid "You want to generate as many murlocs as possible. Typically this is done with cycling Tad and [[Primalfin Lookout||60028]].

[[Magicfin Mycologist||122277]] generates insane value with Brann is the key to being infinite. If you're going hand buff route, have a [[Bream Counter||98509]] in your hand that scales every time you play a Murloc. Mrglin' Burglar is an option to further scale your Bream in hand. Finally, ending units such as [[Bassgill||98926]] and [[Choral Mrrrglr||98948]] help duplicate the stats of your venom. The best way to cap out your board is with as many Bassgills as possible while holding [[Bile Spitter||122219]] to summon from them."

Usually, you want to taunt and reborn the Goldrinn so the Macaw always procs it and it always dies. [[Lightfeather Screecher||122288]] is used to windfury the Macaw to get more Goldrinn procs.
