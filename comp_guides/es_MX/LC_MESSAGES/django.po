msgid "Put as many volumizers on your mechs in combat as possible. [[Apexis Guardian||126820]] counts as 3 magnetics, reborning it double its power, and [[Monstrous Macaw||62230]] and [[Titus Rivendare||97408]] further multiply the magnetic count. Every fight, your board will be better and better because each combat will scale volumizers for future combats. Rolling for board improvements is usually better than buying volumizers from shop. You have the option to go [[Persistent Poet||108463]] plus Amalgam to keep Apexis Guardian stats."

msgstr ""

#: how_to_play | https://hsreplay.net/battlegrounds/comps/67/
msgid "First, scale a huge card in your hand. Most commonly you use [[Brann Bronzebeard||96786]] and cycling Murlocs to scale [[Bream Counter||98509]], but another option is to have a big minion on your board already and then tripling it. Then, you use [[Dramaloc||126643]] + [[Titus Rivendare||97408]] combo to multiply the amount stats in your hand. [[Bassgill||98926]] and [[Costume Enthusiast||126641]] are the best Murlocs to buff with Dramaloc because they additionally benefit from the big minion in hand. [[Monstrous Macaw||62230]] is another multiplier for Dramaloc, and [[Persistent Poet||108463]] plus amalgam is an option to keep Dramaloc stats."

msgid "Buy all the scam cards and try to preserve placements by killing as many units as possible. Keep your strongest units on the board (that's why you want to concentrate stats!) and fill the rest of the board with units that may be able to trade 1 for 1. Aim to golden [[Bassgill||98926]] to summon one or two [[Operatic Belcher||101316]] from hand. Use [[Soul Splitter||95282]] to reborn [[Leeroy the Reckless||90425]]. Golden Soulsplitter can reborn two Leeroys."
