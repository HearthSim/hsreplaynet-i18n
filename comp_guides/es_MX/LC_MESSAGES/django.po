msgid "This comp relies on going infinite and finding some way to turn that infinite gold to stats. A combination  of [[Fleet Admiral Tethys||101122]], [[Brann Bronzebeard||96786]], and [[Visionary Shipman||126810]] will generate you infinite gold. Buy every card this gives another gold on top of it, such as [[Sellemental||64038]], [[Patient Scout||97604]], and [[River Skipper||122092]] to maintain infinity. Most commonly you use [[Cannon Corsair||126812]] to scale your board while cycling infinite gold, but [[Gunpowder Courier||98889]] and [[Plankwalker||128086]] are other options as well. ADVANCED: Keep an [[Air Revenant||126173]] on your board and pivot to [[Acid Rainfall||126171]] when you see it, the scaling is much faster."
