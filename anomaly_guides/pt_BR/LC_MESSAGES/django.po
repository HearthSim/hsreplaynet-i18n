#: Anomaly id 102982 | Guide id 20
msgid "Quests with spellcraft effects are really strong because you get the spellcraft for two turns."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118734 | Guide id 17
msgid "Deathrattle Pirates are very strong in this anomaly if you stay on tavern 5 the entire game. The other good strategy is forcing Golden Brann with Murlocs and/or Dragons."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 106631 | Guide id 91
msgid "Generally, you use your 2 faceless manipulators on the first win condition you see on turn 8, such as goldenning a.Brann or Titus."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102083 | Guide id 93
msgid "Wait a bit after you buy something before rolling, the minion that pops up might be useful."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102457 | Guide id 1
msgid "Your turn 1 buy is very important. Be prepared to only buy cards of that type. In my opinion, the best turn 1 tribes are Nagas, Pirates, and Murlocs."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 119094 | Guide id 22
msgid "For your second hero power, generally the lower armor the hero is, the better option it is. For example, Snake eyes is one of the best second hero powers to pick because it's a 6 armor hero paired alongside the armor of your first hero. Patchwerk technically counts as a 0 armor hero so it's one of the best second hero powers."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 103113 | Guide id 3
msgid "Generally, quests that are easier to complete are better options. For example, pick a \"Summon\" or \"Have minions die\" quest with a deathrattle opener."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102085 | Guide id 43
msgid "Level very fast in this one. Most of the time you're going level 4 on turn 4, or even 5 on 5."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102075 | Guide id 25
msgid "Useless triples are less valuable because they don't give you a triple reward. If you don't plan on keeping a card, don't triple it."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102455 | Guide id 83
msgid "You may want to win every fight, but it's still better to level as opposed to buying trash in the early turns. If you stay down and still don't win, it's game over. Don't buy trash!"
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 103541 | Guide id 70
msgid "[[Brann Bronzebeard||96786]] is the most important card in this anomaly, and single handedly allows you to go infinite because of the sheer quality of the battlecry buddies."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102046 | Guide id 41
msgid "If you have buffs in your hand, use the buffs on the shop and then buy the minion with double header to duplicate the buffs."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 119044 | Guide id 58
msgid "ALWAYS go 3 on 3! Then you can golden a 3 drop on turn 4 and triple into a 4 drop. Use your 3rd arrow on something that wins you the game like golden Brann or Titus."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 101954 | Guide id 28
msgid "Level every turn and be tavern 5 by turn 4. You can do this because of damage cap."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102084 | Guide id 45
msgid "Play this anomaly like you would play Reno. Either golden an early value generator or a win condition."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118670 | Guide id 37
msgid "Try to line up an early triple into a 4 drop, so you can copy the 4 drop turn 4."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118673 | Guide id 39
msgid "APM Comps are easier to snowball gold and go infinite, but otherwise play normally."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 119093 | Guide id 66
msgid "In the late game, you can try to send the Sandy off your board if you have to biggest unit, so your partner can have 2 Sandys."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102748 | Guide id 13
msgid "Pick default panda skin to hide your match history from other people."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118671 | Guide id 16
msgid "Spell based comps are slightly better but mostly play normally."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 119143 | Guide id 67
msgid "One person stays down on tavern 1/2, gives their partner gold to level really fast and start buying premium units early on."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118733 | Guide id 35
msgid "Don't play into the anomaly too much, just enjoy your free stuff."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102875 | Guide id 49
msgid "The best 6 drops are value generators such as [[Deathly Striker||115610]] or [[Neon Agent||115844]]."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102971 | Guide id 85
msgid "Level turn 1! and turn 2! the damage cap is still 5."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102976 | Guide id 7
msgid "Pray to Yogg for good RNG"
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 107226 | Guide id 21
msgid "If there's an OP card that synergizes with another hero in the lobby very well (eg. battlecry with Shudderwock/Brann), then don't give it to them. On the contrary, pick cards that are OP for your hero/comp but not other people's."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102005 | Guide id 55
msgid "Cycle comps such as Murlocs, Elementals, or PIrates, are wayyy better in this anomaly. You can easily go infinite with a single Brann."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 119749 | Guide id 61
msgid "Heroes that benefit from the extra minions at the start are way better, such as Aranna or Sire."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118680 | Guide id 9
msgid "Spell based comps are quite a bit better, such as [[Nalaa the Redeemer||104468]] Menagerie or [[Charging Czarina||110321]] Mechs. Other than that, play normally."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118674 | Guide id 38
msgid "A spell ticket is worth roughly 1 gold. Don't buy trash for the sake of buying a ticket though."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118669 | Guide id 15
msgid "There are some trinkets that are OP in this meta but not OP in Trinket Meta because of different minion pool, so try to think of crazy combos with some trinkets."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102989 | Guide id 59
msgid "For the first few turns, guaranteeing that you lose a fight by holding your unit is better than leaving it up to chance. After you've lost a couple of rounds, you can cash out all your gold on tavern 4, and start betting on yourself after you're confident in the win."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 101992 | Guide id 23
msgid "It's hard to pick heroes that love to level fast on this anomaly, such as maybe [[Snake Eyes||105314]]. You want your hero power to be able to put stats on the board without relying on high tier units."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 119748 | Guide id 30
msgid "Your turn 1 buy is very important, because you'll only get cards from that tribe. Also, it's easy to level fast on this anomaly in order to not buy trash. In my opinion, the best turn 1 tribes are Nagas, Pirates, and Murlocs."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 101986 | Guide id 90
msgid "Staying down and making interest is ALWAYS better than leveling and not making interest. I prefer to not buy any minions turn 1 and start making interest turn 2 onwards. Then, I would spend all the gold on tavern 4 to stabilize."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 119092 | Guide id 57
msgid "ALWAYS go for a 5-6 drop with your scout."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102092 | Guide id 52
msgid "Try rolling 3 times turn 1 and 2 times turn 3 to have a 6/6 monkey and a 3 drop on turn 3. You could even hold the monkey to get a 4 drop on turn 4."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 106500 | Guide id 64
msgid "Try to be on tavern 4 by turn 5! That way, starting turn 6, you can spend your gold rolling instead of leveling."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 103078 | Guide id 82
msgid "Do not skip [[Elise Starseeker||60213]] in this anomaly! It's by far the best way to print 7 drops, and they're pretty OP. With Elise, you really want Golden [[Moira Bronzebeard||103502]], (with [[Captain Sanders||97539]] if it's available), and [[King Varian||102998]] for more money and 6 drops. You can go infinite like this, and scale in whatever way you want."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118688 | Guide id 14
msgid "Spell based comps are slightly better in this anomaly, but other than that play normally and enjoy some free spells."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102076 | Guide id 44
msgid "Break open your piggy bank the turn you want to stabilize (buying strong minions). If you want to stabilize on tavern 4, break open your piggy bank after you level to 4."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102991 | Guide id 34
msgid "It's really hard to hit anything in this anomaly, so maybe you need to buy more marginal cards you wouldn't otherwise buy to become stronger."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102459 | Guide id 84
msgid "Usually, you level to tavern 2 on turn 2, then tavern 3 on turn 4. The best T2 prizes to take are 2 coins and 3 rolls. The best T3 prizes to take are Great Deal and Unlimited Coin."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118697 | Guide id 10
msgid "Don't be afraid to use a good spell when you see it. An early [[Strike Oil||104029]] or [[Time Management||117573]] is much better to use immediately than to hold for a later tier spell."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 118676 | Guide id 56
msgid "You can opt to stay on 2 and either cycle every baller, or play T2 Nagas ([[Thaumaturgist||115563]], [[Zesty Shaker||99054]], [[Lava Lurker||80747]]). The best heroes for this strategy are Silas and Kurtrus."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102090 | Guide id 40
msgid "Golden Brann is utmost priority, and will guarantee you infinite. Then, try to force either Shop Buff Demons or Bassgill Murlocs with Belchers and Bream Counters."
msgstr ""

#: Anomaly id 102792 | Guide id 4
msgid "Spells are really bad to buy in this anomaly. Typically you get one gold back from using [[Chef's Choice||105664]] but in this anomaly the spell is more expensive. Also minions are much more efficient to buy. Also, every single [[Refreshing Anomaly||64042]] is free."
