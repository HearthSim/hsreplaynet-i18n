msgid "Mothership is the best one to pick. Finish the hero power as soon as possible by buying everything that costs effectively 1 ([[Sellemental||64038]], [[Enchanted Lasso||104502]]). Make sure you buy summon units ([[Manasaber||98831]]) to farm 2+ protoss minions per turn. Do not spend any gold leveling to 3 until you've unlocked your minion."

The tier 2 buddy you're looking for is Veranus, and the tier 3 buddies you're looking for are the value generating buddies, the one that gives you a minion every turn. There are quite a bit of them."

"Buddy Guide: Buy the first copy of your buddy when it costs at most 3 gold, because it doesn't generate value. The golden version of your buddy is powerful, and benefits from concentrated stats ([[Avalanche Caller||122780]], [[Insatiable Ur'zul||72060]])"
