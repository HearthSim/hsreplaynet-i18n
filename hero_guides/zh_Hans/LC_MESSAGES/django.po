msgid "This hero is very strong to copy the same, strong spell over and over. With an early [[Strike Oil||104029]], you can hero power every single turn to start printing Strike Oils. Then, later on you generate a strong spell such as [[Golden Touch||104448]] or [[Temperature Shift||117670]] every turn."

If you find a Titus, then you should buy every single Deathrattle upgrade, and possibly even [[Persistent Poet||108463]] to keep the stats from the Deathrattle from the cruiser."
msgstr "战列巡洋舰的升级非常强大，但只能从酒馆等级4开始。前期不要在升级上投入太多，然后从酒馆等级4开始购买一些强力的升级物品。在某些时候，你需要升到6本才能获得复生升级，这简直太超模了。如果你找到了提图斯·瑞文戴尔，那你就该买下所有的亡语升级，甚至可能买下[[执念诗心龙||108463]]以保留巡洋舰上亡语的属性。"
